# Week 1:
* Went through ~60% of Code Academy's Python tutorial.
* Read article on in silico prediction methods.
* Learned basic biological concepts.

# Week 2:
* Ran the VEP webtool on the data filtered by Louis.
* Wrote a script that parses csv files to recover the genomic coordinate from oddly-formatted files from [the REVEL website]("https://sites.google.com/site/revelgenomics/downloads").
* Wrote a script that parses the text file containing the scores of the filtered variants, produced from the VEP Web Tool.
* Wrote a script that extracts the genomic coordinate of the variants from the filtered data-file provided by Melissa.

# Week 3:
* Generalized the hard-coded scripts written in Week 2.
