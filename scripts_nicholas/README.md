# This module contains Nicholas' scripts.
## Each directory contains scripts related to a particular task/element of the pipeline. The directories are:
* General - Contains scripts that run either on all flat file or all types of csv-like files. The scripts in General are not targeted at generating the test/training sets, or doing statistics on the data. None of the files in General are directly involved in the pipeline; the pipeline can run through its entirety without any of the file in General.
* Training-Test - Scripts in this directory perform very specific functions in the pipeline and notes.txt includes a more detailed description of each script.
* EA - Contains one script that extracts Evolutionary Action data specifically.
* REVEL - Contains one script that extracts REVEL data specifically.
* Stats - Scripts to generate various plots showing trends in the data outputted by EA and REVEL.

## [See notes.txt](https://github.com/nicholaslenz12/Summer2018/blob/master/scripts_nicholas/notes.txt) **for a step by step of the pipeline**
